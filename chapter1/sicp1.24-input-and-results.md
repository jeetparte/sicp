# SICP exercise 1.24

Since the Fermat test has an order of growth of ùõ©(log n), we would expect that testing the primes near 1,000,000 would take about twice as long as testing those near 1,000.

Let's look at the test results - 

#### Input data

Found in exercise 1.22:

* Near 1,000 - 983, 991 and 997
* Near 10,000 - 9949, 9967 and 9973
* Near 100,000 - 99971, 99989 and 99991
* Near 1,000,000 - 999961, 999979 and 999983

(__Note:__ I misread  exercise 1.22 and implemented it to find the three largest numbers smaller than _n_.)

#### Results
* **Prime number \*\*\* elapsed time**
* 983 *** 28
* 991 *** 30
* 997 *** 27
* 9949 *** 37
* 9967 *** 37
* 9973 *** 38
* 99971 *** 38
* 99989 *** 41
* 99991 *** 42
* 999961 *** 45
* 999979 *** 46
* 999983 *** 47



The time taken for the largest numbers is a little less than expected. Or rather the time taken for the smallest numbers tested is a bit more.

#### Conclusion

I think this must have something to do with the cost of the modulo operations we are performing. Compare the `expmod` procedure we are using here with  using the older `fast-expt` + a single module operation (we do this comparison in the next exercise).

The performance gains these operations in `expmod` give when `n` is larger, are significantly higher than when `n` is smaller. That must explain the test results.
